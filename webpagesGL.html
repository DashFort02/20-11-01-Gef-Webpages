        <p>Hi! My name is Grady Fort. 
        I have a confession to make- although I claim to be a <em>nerd</em>, I have never seen an episode of <ins>Star Trek</ins>. 
        I do not even know a single word in Klingon! 
        Anywho, I also consider myself to be a part of the wolfpack at NC State- for this distinction, 
        I have a student I.D. to prove it! 
        I enjoyed playing pick up games of frisbee and soccer at the fields over on Centennial campus. 
        Go Pack!!

        <p>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is my favorite <del>element</del> chemical formula. E = 1/2mv<sup>2</sup> is my favorite physics equation.</p>
